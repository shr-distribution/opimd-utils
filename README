This is set of test scripts, used to test and debug opimd.
Although they can be used as daily phone suite, they are
experimental, not complete and they miss some basic features,
and probably it won't change. If you're not opimd developer,
or you're not developing application with opimd support,
then you are using it on your own resposibility.
